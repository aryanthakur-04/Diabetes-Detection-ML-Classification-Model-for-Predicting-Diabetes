# Diabetes Detection ML Classification Model

A comprehensive machine learning classification model for predicting diabetes using the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset. This project includes preprocessing, feature engineering, class imbalance handling (via SMOTE), model training with hyperparameter tuning, evaluation, and interpretability via SHAP. A simple clinical risk scorecard is also generated for intuitive health insights.

## Project Overview

This project tackles diabetes prediction using clinical features such as Glucose level, BMI, Age, Blood Pressure, and more. The pipeline includes:

- Data cleaning and feature engineering  
- Class balancing using SMOTE  
- Model building (Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, XGBoost)  
- Hyperparameter tuning via GridSearchCV  
- Performance evaluation and comparison  
- SHAP-based explainability  
- Risk scorecard generation for health profiling  

## Requirements

Install the required packages using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
````

If `requirements.txt` is missing, here are the core libraries:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn xgboost imbalanced-learn shap
```

## Running the Code

The entire workflow is implemented in a single Jupyter Notebook or Python script. To run it:

1. Ensure the `diabetes.csv` dataset is present in the working directory.
2. Run the Python script (`.py`) from start to finish.

No command-line arguments are needed; it is designed for interactive exploration.

## Features and Workflow

### Data Preprocessing

* Replaces zeroes in medical fields (e.g., Glucose, BMI) with median values.
* One-hot encodes BMI and Age categories for feature enrichment.

### Handling Class Imbalance

* Applies SMOTE to balance classes during model training.

### Model Training and Tuning

Trains and evaluates 4 models:

* Logistic Regression
* Support Vector Machine (SVM)
* Random Forest (GridSearchCV tuned)
* XGBoost (GridSearchCV tuned)

### Evaluation Metrics

* Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, ROC AUC
* Confusion Matrix and ROC Curves
* SHAP values for explainability

### Risk Scorecard

Generates a simplified scoring system using rules based on:

* Glucose
* BMI
* Age
* Blood Pressure

Patients are categorized as Low, Moderate, or High Risk.

## Sample Output

* Model evaluation: Printed metrics, Confusion Matrices, ROC Curves
* SHAP Explanation: Feature impact summary, dependence plots
* Risk Scorecard: Tabular and visual distribution by risk group
